	 * From elastix-4.9.0 manual:
	 *
	 * Rigid: (EulerTransform) A rigid transformation is defined as:
	 * Tμ(x) = R(x − c) + t + c,
	 * with the matrix R a rotation matrix (i.e. orthonormal and proper),
	 * c the centre of rotation, and t translation again.
	 * The image is treated as a rigid body, which can translate and rotate,
	 * but cannot be scaled/stretched.
	 * The rotation matrix is parameterised by the Euler angles (one in 2D, three in 3D).
	 * The parameter vector μ consists of the Euler angles (in rad)
	 * and the translation vector.
	 * In 2D, this gives a vector of length 3: μ = (θz , tx , ty )T ,
	 * where θz denotes the rotation around the axis normal to the image.
	 * In 3D, this gives a vector of length 6: μ = (θx,θy,θz,tx,ty,tz)T .
	 * The centre of rotation is not part of μ; it is a fixed setting,
	 * usually the centre of the image.
	 *
	 * Note: Elastix units are always millimeters
	 *
	 * For 2D transform, the rotation is assumed to occur along the Z axis,
	 * and Z coordinates are set to 0 by default see {@link ElastixEulerTransform2D}
	 * implementation for details. These defaults allow to conveniently reuse
	 * the conversion from the class {@link ElastixEuler3DToAffineTransform3D}
	 *
	 * @param elastixEulerTransform2D
	 *
	 * @return an affine transform performing the Euler transform, in millimeter units
